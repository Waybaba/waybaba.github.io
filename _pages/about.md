There are some information about me, which mainly focus on academic experiences.

## Under building ...

This website has not been finished â€¦

## Who am I ?

I am a undergraduate students in **Tianjin University** in China. I am majoring in **Communication Engineering** ( or more broad, Information Technology ) and our courses include both software and hardware. For more general information about me, click the **CV** button of the menu bar, which you can find at the top of this page.

Beyond of my major, I also spend a lot of time and energy in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which I believe is the most powerful tool of the next century. My research experiences cover **action recognition**, **blood recognition**, **medical** **image denoting** and some other applications of deep learning. For more details about my research experiences, please click on the **PROJECTS** button of the top menu bar.

Besides of this, I am interested in **electronic product designing** too.  TODO

As you can see, most of my experiences are not related to communication system. To be honest, I do not like to communicaiton related things such as decoding and coding although communication system is really important in our daily life.

By the way, this is my third year spend in the university, which means I am going to graduate the next year. I am planning to study aboard for my Phd. degree and looking for someone to fund me.
